# e-farming-system
Project
BACKGROUND
Agriculture is the backbone of the rural economy in Kenya, where a significant portion of the population relies on small-scale farming for their livelihood. Despite its critical role, small-scale farmers encounter several persistent challenges that impede their productivity and economic well-being. Understanding these challenges is essential for developing effective solutions.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Small-scale farmers in rural Kenya struggle with limited access to critical information and resources necessary for optimal farming practices. The lack of real-time market prices, reliable weather forecasts, and sustainable farming techniques hinders their productivity and profitability. Furthermore, the absence of direct connections to buyers forces farmers to rely on intermediaries, resulting in lower profit margins. This project aims to address these challenges by developing the E-farming System, a digital platform designed to provide comprehensive support to small-scale farmers.
