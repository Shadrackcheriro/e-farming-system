# e-farming-system
Project

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Small-scale farmers in rural Kenya struggle with limited access to critical information and resources necessary for optimal farming practices. The lack of real-time market prices, reliable weather forecasts, and sustainable farming techniques hinders their productivity and profitability. Furthermore, the absence of direct connections to buyers forces farmers to rely on intermediaries, resulting in lower profit margins. This project aims to address these challenges by developing the E-farming System, a digital platform designed to provide comprehensive support to small-scale farmers.
